/*
Let's see some of the problems where segment trees may not be helpful.
(1)Given an array of size N and Q queries of the form L,R,K, find number of elements in the range L to R which are strictly smaller than K.
(2)Given an array of size N and Q queries of the form L R,find number of unique elements in the range L to R.
-->We can solve this using Mo's algo as well,but that would require all queries to be offline(already known),we want a 'good' algo for online queries as well.

We are gonna solve the following probs:
(1)Coloring Trees(Hackerrank)
(2)Subtree Minimum Query(Codeforces)
[requires 'Flattening of Trees']
